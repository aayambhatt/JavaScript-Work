        <h2>How to get started</h2>

        <p>Unlike many outdoor sports, getting started with bouldering is surprisingly simple. All you need are some climbing shoes, chalk, and a positive attitude—most gyms even rent the equipment for your first sessions. <strong>No prior experience or complex gear required!</strong>
